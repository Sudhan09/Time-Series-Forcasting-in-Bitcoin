# Time-Series-Forcasting-in-Bitcoin
# Time Series Forecasting in TensorFlow (BitPredict ðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ)

This project explores **time series forecasting** using TensorFlow, focusing on predicting Bitcoin prices. The goal is to understand working with time series data, preprocess it, and build machine learning models for forecasting.

ðŸš¨ **Note:** This is not financial advice. Predicting stock/crypto prices using time series forecasting is highly challenging and often unreliable.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

We use historical Bitcoin price data from **01 October 2013 to 18 May 2021**, sourced from **Coindesk**. You can download the dataset from [Coindesk Bitcoin Prices](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin).

Alternatively, find the dataset on GitHub: [BTC_USD_2013-10-01_2021-05-18-CoinDesk.csv](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/BTC_USD_2013-10-01_2021-05-18-CoinDesk.csv).
